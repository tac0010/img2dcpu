--- Release Information ---
April 13, 2012 - v0.1: Initial Release. Only works with 24-bit bitmaps.
 
--- Description ---
img2dcpu allows you to convert a color bitmap image into code that can be used 
to display the image on the DCPU in Mojang's new space game, 0x10c. Currently, 
the specification of the IO system in 0x10c allows for a 32x12-tile screen,
where each tile consists of a 4x8 character. img2dcpu can create assembly code
that can display a 32x24 color image on the DCPU screen by making use of a 
custom font, splitting each tile into two square pixels. Future work includes
dividing the tile further so that a full 128x96 image can be generated and
displayed.

--- Usage ---
> img2dcpu [imagefilename] [outputfilename]

imagefilename   The filename of the bitmap image that is to be converted.
outputfilename  The filename of the text file that will contain the DCPU code.

If no arguments are provided, the help message will be displayed.

--- Limitations ---
As of v0.1, img2dcpu can only convert from a 32x24 24-bit color BMP image, but
future releases may include other image types and resolutions. Also, img2dcpu
uses Windows-only libraries for reading in the bitmap file, so it is not
currently cross-platform compatible.
